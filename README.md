# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
A Python-based machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using **logistic regression**. The model is trained on structured clinical data and demonstrates a complete supervised learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies a logistic regression classifier to clinical-style input features in order to perform binary classification. It is designed to be simple, interpretable, and easy to extend, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas
## 📊 Dataset & Features
The model uses the following input features:
